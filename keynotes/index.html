            <h5 class="text-primary">The Power of Fuzzing and Large Language Models</h5>
            <p class="text-justify">
              <strong>Abstract</strong>:
              Feedback-directed fuzzing (a.k.a. coverage-guided or grey-box fuzzing) algorithms and their efficient implementation have shown themselves to be a 
              force in the field of automated testing and bug discovery. These algorithms do great at exploring search spaces through mutation, when each evaluation 
              run is cheap. Large language models have emerged as a force in the generation of both natural language and code, showing promise for search tasks over 
              these spaces. This keynote will cover projects that show the power of feedback-directed-fuzzing on its own, and how large language models can be used most 
              effectively in conjunction with and complement to automated testing techniques.

            <!-- <p><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EF13eiidhA0?start=571" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> -->

              <strong>Abstract</strong>:
              Programming is increasingly taught using dedicated block-based programming environments such as Scratch. 
              While the use of blocks instead of text prevents syntax errors, learners can still make semantic mistakes, 
              implying a need for feedback and help. Professional programmers can receive such support from efficient 
              program analyses built into their IDEs, but block-based programming environments offer no such support. 
              In this talk, I will describe some of our efforts to remedy this issue, which are based on search-based 
              testing at the core. The colourful and small nature of learners’ programs is deceiving, as the game-like, 
              highly concurrent and event-driven nature of the programs poses unique challenges for these analyses.

              <strong>Abstract</strong>:
              Software testing is indispensable in software development, yet often overlooked, contributing to a shortage of expertise in the software industry. 
              Despite efforts to improve teaching approaches at the university level, challenges persist, particularly in bridging the gap between theory and 
              practice and better preparing students for their future careers.
              This talk will provide a closer look at how software testing is taught at the academic level, considering the perspectives of students and teachers. 
              I will describe the most common challenges that students experience when taking a software testing course.
              Then, I give voice to teachers, reporting the approaches they usually adopt in software testing courses and the challenges they face. 
              Emerging initiatives like gamification and challenge-based learning are potential solutions to fill the gaps between the teachers’ efforts and students’ needs.
