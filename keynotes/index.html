              <strong>Abstract</strong>:
              Feedback-directed fuzzing (a.k.a. coverage-guided or grey-box fuzzing) algorithms and their efficient implementation have shown themselves to be a 
              force in the field of automated testing and bug discovery. These algorithms do great at exploring search spaces through mutation, when each evaluation 
              run is cheap. Large language models have emerged as a force in the generation of both natural language and code, showing promise for search tasks over 
              these spaces. This keynote will cover projects that show the power of feedback-directed-fuzzing on its own, and how large language models can be used most 
              effectively in conjunction with and complement to automated testing techniques.

              <strong>Biography</strong>: Lionel C. Briand is professor of software engineering and has shared
              appointments between (1) The University of Ottawa, Canada and (2) The SnT centre for Security,
              Reliability, and Trust, University of Luxembourg. In collaboration with colleagues, over 25 years, he
              has run many collaborative research projects with companies in the automotive, satellite, aeropsace,
              energy, financial, and legal domains. Lionel has held various engineering, academic, and leading
              positions in six countries. He was one of the founders of the ICST conference (IEEE Int. Conf. on
              Software Testing, Verification, and Validation, a CORE A event) and its first general chair. He was also
              EiC of Empirical Software Engineering (Springer) for 13 years and led, in collaboration with first
              Victor Basili and then Tom Zimmermann, the journal to the top tier of the very best publication venues
              in software engineering.
              <br />
              Lionel was elevated to the grades of IEEE Fellow and ACM Fellow for his work on software testing and
              verification. He was granted the IEEE Computer Society Harlan Mills award, the ACM SIGSOFT outstanding
              research award, and the IEEE Reliability Society engineer-of-the-year award, respectively in 2012, 2022,
              and 2013. He received an ERC Advanced grant in 2016 — on the topic of modelling and testing
              cyber-physical systems — which is the most prestigious individual research award in the European Union.
              He currently holds a Canada Research Chair (Tier 1) on "Intelligent Software Dependability and
              Compliance". His research interests include: software testing and verification, applications of AI in
              software engineering, model-driven software development, requirements engineering, and empirical
              software engineering.

            <h5 class="text-primary">Truth or Dare: Real-World Fuzz Testing of UAVs in
              Flight</h5>

              <strong>Abstract</strong>:
              Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) need to meet rigorous safety requirements when deployed in
              high-stress emergency response scenarios. This requires systematic testing of the hardware, software,
              communication networks, and human interaction points. Fuzz testing is particularly effective at finding
              failures in edge cases that might otherwise be missed. In Cyber-Physical Systems, such as sUAS, tests
              typically move from simulation to the real-world; however, tests which execute perfectly in simulation
              can sometimes fail dramatically when run on physical sUAS, highlighting the importance of augmenting
              simulations with real-world Fuzz tests. Unfortunately real-world fuzzing is not only incredibly
              time-consuming, but also potentially hazardous because the inevitable failures produced by effective
              fuzz tests can cause sUAS to physically crash or fly-away. In this talk, Cleland-Huang will draw upon
              her own real-world experiences of developing and validating software for sUAS applications, and will
              explore the `truths’ and ‘dares’ of Fuzzing in the Field. The truth is that in the normal course of
              running physical flight tests, accidental erroneous input values can cause dramatic failures and
              crashes, but can also be incredibly helpful at revealing points of fragility in the system where
              modifications are needed. However, accidental fuzzing falls far short of the systematic goals of true
              fuzzing, introducing the non-trivial dilemma of how to safely deploy Fuzz Testing in the field. This
              talk explores this `dare’, by exploring a systematic approach for fuzz testing physical sUAS systems,
              thereby empowering testers to identify real-world weaknesses in edge-cases that could have been missed
              in simulation. The end result is increased robustness in real-world sUAS systems.
