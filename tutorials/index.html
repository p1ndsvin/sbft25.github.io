                  <strong>Abstract</strong>:
                  In this talk, I will give an overview of our recent results in randomized testing ("fuzzing") and present some of the techniques we have developed in recent years. 
                  These include fuzzing complex software systems such as operating system kernels, hypervisors, and interpreters using various testing methods. I will also discuss 
                  how fuzzing relates to games such as Super Mario Bros. or Sokoban.

                  <strong>Abstract</strong>:
                  Sokoban, a puzzle game developed in the early 1980s, has
                    proven to be a challenging search optimisation problem often aligned
                    with autonomous agent research. The eponymous "warehouse keeper"
                    attempts to move crates into desired positions, often encountering
                    difficult terrain and situations as crates the players themselves have
                    moved block the path. These puzzles prove to be difficult for humans
                    and computers alike, and general-purpose solving for Sokoban puzzles is
                    PSPACE-complete as shown by previous research. To improve the academic
                    understanding of the problem, we propose a King-of-the-Hill (KotH)
                    competition in which competitors develop both automated puzzle solvers
                    and generators. With this, we hope to identify what puzzle features
                    weaken which optimisation strategies, what strategies can be used to
                    defeat new challenges, and observe specialised adversarial techniques
                    to target and disrupt tactics employed by various competitors.

                  <strong>Abstract</strong>:
                  SynTest-Framework is a user-friendly, modular, and highly extensible ecosystem for automatic test case generation and fuzzing. 
                  Its architecture allows testing tools for different programming languages to be built on top of it. Additionally, 
                  the framework contains a collection of language-independent search algorithms that are optimized for automatic test 
                  case generation and fuzzing. Our main goal with the framework is to make it easier for researchers to implement new 
                  approaches for automatic test case generation. Additionally, we hope that the framework will make it easier for 
                  practitioners to adopt automatic test case generation in their projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this tutorial session, we will show how to use the framework to implement a new automatic test case generation approach. 
                  Furthermore, we will also show how to use the framework to implement a new testing tool. The tutorial will be hands-on 
                  and will consist of a series of practical scenarios. These scenarios will be based on the TypeScript programming language. 
                  Join us in this fun and interactive tutorial session and equip yourself with the skills to demonstrate your approach to 
                  software testing and validation.
